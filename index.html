        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p><span>Our Mission:</span> Greenpeace is a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use
            peaceful
            protest and
            creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a
            green and peaceful future.
            <br><br>
            <span>Our History:</span> A group of thoughtful, committed citizens came together in 1971 to create
            Greenpeace. A handful
            of determined activists leased a small fishing vessel, called the Phyllis Cormack, and set sail from
            Vancouver for Amchitka Island in Alaska. Their mission was to protest U.S. nuclear testing off the coast of
            Alaska with a brave act of defiance: to place themselves in harm’s way.
            Despite being intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard, these daring activists sailed into history by bringing
            worldwide attention to the dangers of nuclear testing.
            <br><br>
            <span>Our Work:</span> That was more than 40 years ago, and in that time, Greenpeace has indeed changed the
            world. And we
            continue to make the world a better place. Our committed activists and supporters have come together to ban
            commercial whaling, convince the world’s leaders to stop nuclear testing, protect Antarctica, and so much
            more. Today, we have grown from a small group of dedicated activists to an international organization with
            offices in more than 50 countries. But our spirit and our mission remain the same. Our fight to save the
            planet has grown more serious—the climate change impacts, destruction of ancient forests, deterioration of
            our oceans, and the threat of a nuclear disaster loom large.
            Greenpeace is actively working to address these and other threats.
            <br><br>
            <span>Our Valunteers:</span> We work with thousands of volunteers who are on the inside track of our
            campaigns. Whether
            you’ve been an activist for decades or you’re just starting and want to learn how you can help, we have
            volunteer opportunities for you.
            <br><br>
            <span>Our Funding:</span> Greenpeace does not solicit contributions from government or corporations, nor
            will we endorse
            political candidates. Our 250,000 members in the United States and 2.8 million members worldwide provide
            virtually all of our funding through individual contributions. Your support provides the backbone of our
            organization and is invaluable to our efforts.
